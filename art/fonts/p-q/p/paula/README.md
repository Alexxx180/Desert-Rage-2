Font name: Paula regular

Basic Font Information: A subtle touch of Art DÃ©co in a contemporary clean Sans-Serif.
Ordinary yet non-ordinary: sharp angles make good friendship with oval curves, all born from the same source which is the Golden Ratio's proportion. Slightly influenced by Century Gothic and Helvetica in some of its traits. 
Well readable and suitable for editorial projects, titles, logotypes, online and offline communication projects.
Bold, Thin and Italic will follow in the future to populate the family.
